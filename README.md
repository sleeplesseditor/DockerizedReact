# DockerizedReact

An early experiment in Dockerizing a boilerplate React app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get this up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd DockerizedReact
2) docker build . -t [INSERT OWN TAG FOR BUILD]
3) docker run -p 8080:80 [USE OWN TAG FROM BUILD]
